*Parliament may make provision in respect of elections.*

# 101.

1. The Parliament may by law make provision for -

    a. the registration of electors;

    b. the prescribing of a qualifying date on which a person should be resident in any electoral district to be entered in the register of electors of that electoral district;

    c. the prescribing of a qualifying date on which a person should have attained the age of eighteen years to qualify for the purposes of registration as an elector;

    d. the preparation and revision of registers of electors;

    e. the procedure for the election of Members of Parliament;

    f. the creation of offences relating to such elections and the punishment therefor;

    g. the grounds for avoiding such elections, and where an election has been held void the manner of holding fresh elections;

    h. the form and manner in which vacancies shall be filled when all the candidates whose names appearing in the nomination paper of a recognized political party or independent group have been exhausted by election or otherwise or where a recognized political party or independent group has been proscribed under Article 157AÂ ; and

    i. the manner of determination of disputed elections and such other matters as are necessary or incidental to the election of Members of Parliament:

    Provided that no such law shall add to the disqualifications specified in Articles 89 and 91.

2. Until Parliament by law makes provision for such matters, the Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Order in Council, 1946 as amended from time to time, shall, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, mutatis mutandis, apply.
