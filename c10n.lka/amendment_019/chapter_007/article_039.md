*Determination by the Supreme Court that the President was not duly elected or the election of the President was void.*

# 39.

    1. Where the Supreme Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 130 determines -

        a. that the election of the President was void and does not determine that any other person was duly elected, then, a poll for the election of the President shall be taken not later than three months from the date of the determinationÂ ; or

        b. that any other person was duly elected as President, then, such other person shall assume the office of President within one month of the date of the determination.

        For the purposes of Article 38 (1)

        d. , the date of commencement of the term of office of the new President shall be the date of his election or the date of the determination, as the case may be.

    2. Upon the Supreme Court making any such determination as is referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article, the person who was exercising, performing and discharging the powers, duties and functions of the office of President shall forthwith cease to exercise, perform and discharge such powers, duties and functions. During the period intervening between the date of such determination and the assumption of office by the new President, the Prime Minister shall act in the office of President and shall appoint one of the other Minister of the Cabinet to act in the office of the Prime Minister:

    Provided that if the office of Prime Minister be then vacant or the Prime Minister is unable to act, the Speaker shall act in the office of the President.

    3. For the purposes of Article 30(2) and notwithstanding the provisions of Article 31 (4), the term of office of the new President shall be deemed to have commenced on the date on which the term of office of the person whose election was determined to have been void or undue would, but for such determination, have commenced.

    4. The exercise, performance and discharge by any person of the powers, duties and functions of the office of the President shall not be invalid by reason only of the fact that the Supreme Court subsequently determines that the election of such person as President was void or undue.

    5. The provisions of this Article shall apply notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 40.
